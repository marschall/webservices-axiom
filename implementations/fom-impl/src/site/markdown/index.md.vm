About
-----

The FOM (Feed Object Model) implementation is designed as a replacement for
Apache Abdera's `abdera-parser` component and allows you to use Abdera 1.1.3
(released in 2012) with the latest Axiom release. To use it, remove `abdera-parser`
from your project, and add `fom-impl`, together with its dependencies. E.g. if you
use Maven:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.ws.commons.axiom</groupId>
        <artifactId>fom-impl</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
    </dependency>


Note: currently the FOM implementation also implements the Axiom API; this may
change in the future.
