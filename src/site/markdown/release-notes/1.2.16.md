Apache Axiom 1.2.16 Release Note
--------------------------------

Highlights in this release:

*   DOOM now has `OMSourcedElement` support.

*   Axiom now ships a drop-in replacement for `abdera-parser`, so that the latest Axiom
    version can be used together with Abdera 1.1.3. See [here][1] for more details.
