Apache Axiom 1.2.14 Release Note
--------------------------------

Axiom 1.2.14 contains fixes for more than twenty [JIRA issues][1] as well as lots of other
improvements.

Users upgrading to 1.2.14 should take into account the following changes:

*   Axiom now uses Woodstox 4.1.x as StAX implementation (although 3.2.x and 4.0.x are still
    supported).

*   `OMFactory` implementations for DOOM are now stateless.

*   Several deprecated classes have been moved to a new JAR file named `axiom-compat` and are no
    longer included in the core artifacts (`axiom-api`, `axiom-impl` and `axiom-dom`).

For more information about the possible impact on existing application code of these changes,
please refer to the [user guide][2].
