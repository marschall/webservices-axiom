Apache Axiom 1.2.13 Release Note
--------------------------------

Axiom 1.2.13 contains fixes for over thirty [JIRA issues][1] as well as lots of other improvements,
mainly related to XOP/MTOM processing, namespace handling, DOM support, documentation and code
quality.

The most prominent change in 1.2.13 is that Axiom no longer uses its own MIME parser, but instead
relies on [Apache James Mime4J][2] for XOP/MTOM processing. This was done in order to support
streaming of the content of MIME parts in XOP/MTOM messages: they can now be processed without
writing them to memory or disk first. This also applies to the root/SOAP part, which in previous
versions was always read into memory before parsing could start.

For more information about the possible impact on existing application code of the changes
included in Axiom 1.2.13, please refer to the [user guide][3].
