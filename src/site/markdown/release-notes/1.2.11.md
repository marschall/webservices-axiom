Apache Axiom 1.2.11 Release Note
--------------------------------

Axiom 1.2.11 is a maintenance release to support the upcoming Axis2 1.6 release.
It also introduces a couple of new APIs that make it easier to support alternative
Axiom implementations and that eliminate the need to refer to internal Axiom APIs.

Resolved JIRA issues:

* [AXIOM-12] - OMOutputFormat: doSWA and doOptimize should be mutually exclusive...plus we need doOptimizeThreshold
* [AXIOM-24] - OMDocument#serializeAndConsume doesn't consume the document
* [AXIOM-172] - OMChildrenQNameIterator doesn't work correctly if hasNext() is not called before next()
* [AXIOM-274] - Refactor/deprecate MIMEOutputUtils
* [AXIOM-275] - Implement non JavaMail implementation of MultipartWriter
* [AXIOM-313] - Add a new getDocumentElement method to StAXOMBuilder that allows to discard the OMDocument
* [AXIOM-333] - getFirstChildWithName should not read the next element.
* [AXIOM-346] - Enhance OMStAXWrapper/OMNavigator to work with OMDocument objects
* [AXIOM-351] - Links in Javadoc JARs are broken
* [AXIOM-352] - StAXDialectDetector doesn't recognize com.bea.core.weblogic.stax_1.7.0.0.jar
