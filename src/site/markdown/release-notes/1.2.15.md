Apache Axiom 1.2.15 Release Note
--------------------------------

Axiom 1.2.15 ships fixes for over a dozen [JIRA issues][1] and contains many other improvements,
mainly related to consistency between the LLOM and DOOM implementations and how serialization is
performed. In particular the builder is now able to continue building the Axiom tree after an
element has been consumed (see [AXIOM-288][2]).

For information about other changes and their potential impact, please refer to the [user
guide][3].
