Welcome to Apache Axiom

  The Apache Axiom\u2122 library provides an XML Infoset compliant object model
  implementation which supports on-demand building
  of the object tree. It supports a novel "pull-through" model which allows one to turn off the tree
  building and directly access the underlying pull event stream using the StAX API. It also has built in support for XML
  Optimized Packaging (XOP) and MTOM, the combination of which allows XML to carry binary data
  efficiently and in a transparent manner. The combination of these is an easy to use API with a very
  high performant architecture!

  Developed as part of Apache Axis2, Apache Axiom is the core of Apache Axis2. However, it is a pure
  standalone XML Infoset model with novel features and can be used independently of Apache Axis2.

Latest Release

  \[{{{./download.cgi}Download Axiom 1.2.15}}\]

  <<XXX June 2015 - Apache Axiom Version 1.2.15 Released!>>
  
  Axiom 1.2.15 ships fixes for over a dozen {{{https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12311190&version=12318876}JIRA issues}}
  and contains many other improvements, mainly related to consistency between the LLOM and DOOM implementations and how serialization is performed.
  In particular the builder is now able to continue building the Axiom tree after an element has been consumed
  (see {{{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIOM-288}AXIOM-288}}).

  For information about other changes and their potential impact, please refer to the {{{./userguide/ch04.html#changes-1.2.15}user guide}}.

Previous Releases

  <<2nd December 2012 - Apache Axiom Version 1.2.14 Released!>>
  
  Axiom 1.2.14 contains fixes for more than twenty {{{https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12311190&version=12318340}JIRA issues}}
  as well as lots of other improvements.
  
  Users upgrading to 1.2.14 should take into account the following changes:
  
    * Axiom now uses Woodstox 4.1.x as StAX implementation (although 3.2.x and 4.0.x are still supported).
    
    * <<<OMFactory>>> implementations for DOOM are now stateless.
    
    * Several deprecated classes have been moved to a new JAR file named <<<axiom-compat>>> and are no
      longer included in the core artifacts (<<<axiom-api>>>, <<<axiom-impl>>> and <<<axiom-dom>>>).
  
  For more information about the possible impact on existing application code of these changes,
  please refer to the {{{./userguide/ch04.html#changes-1.2.14}user guide}}.
  
  <<2nd April 2012 - Apache Axiom Version 1.2.13 Released!>>
  
  Axiom 1.2.13 contains fixes for over thirty {{{https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12311190&version=12316677}JIRA issues}}
  as well as lots of other improvements, mainly related to XOP/MTOM processing, namespace handling, DOM support, documentation
  and code quality.
  
  The most prominent change in 1.2.13 is that Axiom no longer uses its own MIME parser, but instead relies
  on {{{http://james.apache.org/mime4j/}Apache James Mime4J}} for XOP/MTOM processing. This was done in order to
  support streaming of the content of MIME parts in XOP/MTOM messages: they can now be processed without writing
  them to memory or disk first. This also applies to the root/SOAP part, which in previous versions was always read
  into memory before parsing could start.

    * [AXIOM-63] - OMXMLStreamReaderValidator incorrectly reports mismatched END_ELEMENT events
    
    * [AXIOM-305] - Need OMElement.getNamespaceURI() convenience method
    
    * [AXIOM-354] - Potential class loader leak caused by the thread local in org.apache.axiom.util.UIDGenerator
    
    * [AXIOM-356] - OMElement#resolveQName implementations use incorrect algorithm to resolve unprefixed QNames

  <<3rd February 2011 - Apache Axiom Version 1.2.11 Released!>>
  
  Axiom 1.2.11 is a maintenance release to support the upcoming Axis2 1.6 release.
  It also introduces a couple of new APIs that make it easier to support alternative
  Axiom implementations and that eliminate the need to refer to internal Axiom APIs.
  
  Resolved JIRA issues:
  
    * [AXIOM-12] - OMOutputFormat: doSWA and doOptimize should be mutually exclusive...plus we need doOptimizeThreshold
    
    * [AXIOM-24] - OMDocument#serializeAndConsume doesn't consume the document

    * [AXIOM-346] - Enhance OMStAXWrapper/OMNavigator to work with OMDocument objects
    
    * [AXIOM-351] - Links in Javadoc JARs are broken

  Please refer to the {{{./userguide/ch04.html#changes-1.2.11}user guide}} for additional
  information about changes in Axiom 1.2.11.

  <<30th October 2010 - Apache Axiom Version 1.2.10 Released!>>
  
  Axiom 1.2.10 is a maintenance release that contains the following improvements:
  
    * Improved DOM compatibility and performance for DOOM. Users running Rampart on Axis2 1.5.2
      may want to upgrade Axiom to 1.2.10 to take advantage of these improvements.
    
    * Improved interoperability with various StAX implementation, in particular
      support for Woodstox 4.0.
    
    * It is now possible to specify a configuration when requesting an <<<XMLStreamWriter>>>
      from <<<StAXUtils>>>, similarly to what is already possible for <<<XMLStreamReader>>>
      instances. This feature is required to support the next Abdera release
      (see {{{https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ABDERA-267}ABDERA-267}}).
  
  <<13th June 2010 - Apache Axiom Version 1.2.9 Released!>>

  Note: Starting with release 1.2.9, Axiom requires Java 1.5. While the API is
  still compatible with Java 1.4, Axiom relies on classes from the Java 1.5
  runtime environment. Some of its dependencies also require Java 1.5.

  Highlights in this release:
  
    * Improved interoperability with StAX implementations other than Woodstox. Axiom now
      detects the StAX implementation that is used and works around interoperability issues.
      In particular, version 1.2.9 solves the longstanding concurrency issue that occurs
      when using Axiom with SJSXP.

    * Better control over XMLInputFactory and XMLOutputFactory settings. It is now possible
      to use property files to define application wide default settings for the StAX factories
      used by <<<StAXUtils>>>. It is also possible to specify a particular configuration when
      requesting a StAX parser from <<<StAXUtils>>>.

    * Improved XOP/MTOM handling. Axiom 1.2.9 is able to stream binary/base64 data in several
      situations where this was not possible previously. The behavior of Axiom 1.2.9 is also
      more consistent with respect to XOP encoded data sent to the application, solving
      some issues where attachments were processed incorrectly.
	
    * Improved documentation. There is now more and better Javadoc. Also, a user guide
      is available in HTML and as PDF.
    
    * Better OSGi support.
    
    * Improved consistency of the core interfaces. E.g. <<<OMDocument>>> now has a <<<build>>>
      method.
